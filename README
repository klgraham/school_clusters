Cluster Analysis of Schools

This performs a simple cluster analysis on a group of public schools. Several variables or groups of them can be used as the basis of clustering, including demographic data like racial/ethnic composition, poverty level or free or reduced lunch enrollment percentage (FRPL), or various test scores. Other data can also be used, since this is just exploratory and descriptive.
